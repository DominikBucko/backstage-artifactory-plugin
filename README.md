Welcome to the Artifactory plugins for Backstage!

This is a combination of 2 plugins - the [frontend](./plugins/artifactory/README.md) and the [backend](./plugins/artifactory-backend/README.md).

The purpose of these plugins is to bring software artifacts forward - where developers can see them.
You can now easily connect your software components and services to their binary artifacts and browse the relevant artifacts directly from your Bacsktage IDP.
